Working with serialports can be hard, this is a collection of projects that make it easier.

Goto https://serialport.io/ to learn more.

We currently have the following packages.

- `serialport` [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/serialport.svg?maxAge=2592000)](http://npmjs.com/package/serialport) the only package you need to get started.
- `@serialport/stream` our traditional stream interface with nothing else
- `@serialport/binding-abstract` as an abstract class for all bindings
- `@serialport/binding-mock` for a mock binding package
- Parser Byte Length
- Parser cctalk
- Parser delimiter
- Parser readline
- Parser ready
- Parser regex
- Parser slip-encoder

## Intro to Node-Serialport

Imagine a world where you can write JavaScript to control blenders, lights, security systems, or even robots. That's rightâ€”robots! Thanks to Node Serialport, that world is here.

Node-Serialport provides an interface for the low-level serial port code necessary to control [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) chipsets, X10 interfaces, [Zigbee](http://www.zigbee.org/) radios, highway signs, lcd screens, cash drawers, motor controllers, sensor packages, fork lifts, modems, drones, CNC machines, plotters, vending machines, ccTalk coin accecptors, SMS Gateways, RFID scanners and much more. If you have a hardware device with a [UART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver/transmitter) we can speak to it. The physical world is your oyster with this goodie.

For a full breakdown of why we made Node-Serialport, please read [NodeBots - The Rise of JS Robotics](http://www.voodootikigod.com/nodebots-the-rise-of-js-robotics). It explains why one would want to program robots in JS in the first place. It's not being against firmware but we can be better than it.
